*After consulting ancient codes in search of the dream lands, one night you went to sleep and started dreaming. It was not a dream like the others, it was vivid and real, so much so that you could not distinguish it from the wake. Time seems to pass more slowly in the Dream Lands and any attempt you made to wake up has been in vain.*
*In this world, everyone addresses you by another name and claims that you have always been someone else. The memories of this identity of yours are vague and superimposed on your memories of the Waking World. Having Failed to find the way to awake, you started living your life here.*
*The Dream is sometimes full of wonders, other times of unmentionable horrors and now you have to face this life beyond imagination. Now you are a **Roamer of the Dream**. Will you ever find a way to wake up?*
